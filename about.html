        <h1>We are n8n Experts.</h1>
        <p>Aether AI was founded on the belief that automation is the key to unlocking human potential. We chose n8n as our core tool to make that a reality for our clients.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section container">
        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>We didn't just adopt n8n; we were built around it. Our team consists of data engineers and AI researchers who saw the power of n8n's open, extensible platform. While other consultants are split between dozens of tools, we have dedicated ourselves to mastering one. This focus allows us to build solutions that are deeper, more reliable, and more creative than anyone else in the market.</p>
